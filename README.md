# Advent-of-Code

Started in November 2017, as a way to get more points in a C# course, but having so much fun doing the tasks I decided to solve previous years and the ones that are yet to come.

Goal: Optimize all solutions and find various ways of solving each day.

Result(Expected): Learn the language that I'm working with.
Result(Achieved): //still in process
